# Task Board

Task Board - A simple Kanban board for task management

## Description

This webpage tracks the personal tasks of the user.  Each task will record the Title, Due Date and Description of any task that the user wants to track.  Each task can be dragged and dropped into three different category areas:  "To Do", "In Progress" and "Done".  If the due date of the task is the same as Today's Date, the task card will turn Yellow.  If the due date of the task is older than Today's Date, the task card will be Red.
